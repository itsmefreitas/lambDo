# lambDo
A lambda calculus interpreter/evaluator, using call-by-name, call-by-value and call-by-need reduction strategies.

Evaluators implemented in this project are inspired on theoretical formalisms and extended with helper functions to reflect or guarantee evaluation properties/order when applicable.
